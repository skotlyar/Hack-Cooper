# Hack-Cooper

This respository is home to a very early project of mine.
I conceptualized a Space-Invaders-esque game that would teach the importance of having a 
secure password by initializing a user's health to the strength of a password they
enter before starting the game. The rendering was completed through the Java Swing API.
The movement of the game has not been completed, but the password strength algorithm has.
